# nSMM
Repository for nSMM with development resources and assets.

The aim is to make a Super Mario game with a level editor for the TI-nSpire CX line of calculators in Lua. It runs extremely poorly due to hardware limitations but is a fun side project of mine. You are free to inspect the code, suggest changes and tell me how unoptimised things can be to the seasoned developer's eye - just contact me in the Discord server above.
